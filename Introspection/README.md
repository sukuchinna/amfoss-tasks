#Introspection

###Why must we choose you?
Actually after my Intermediate I started searching universities.My brother told me,try to get a seat in Amrita School of Engineering.I asked why? He said that you can find many clubs in Amrita.So i searched in google about clubs in Amrita. And I got a lot of information about clubs like amfoss,Glitch,Bios etc..I decided to join in Amfoss club but I didnt know anything about programmimg.But the club has a lot of multifacted people.I could help myself in learning and improving my knowledge.I think I can get more opportunities to participate in hackathons etc.. if I join.I wanted  to learn new things other than academics and I wanted to improve my skills like communication,organizing events,convincing people etc..So I decided to join Amfoss.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I wanted to join new projects as well as learning new programmimg languages and to maintain good CGPA overall.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will try to improve the name of the club and I will help all members by sharing the knowledge which I have and I will help the club in taking the right members in the forthcoming years.

###DO you have any feedback for the selection process?
Honestly,I dont know anything about selection process.But the tasks given by them are very challenging and for the members who didnt know anything about programming will face some difficulties in completing the tasks .So In my view the selection process could include looking into the individuals previous knowledge and achievements.
